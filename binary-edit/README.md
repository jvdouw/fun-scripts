# Binary edit

## Readme from one perspective
The script `asciiedit.sh` is possibly the most nerdy text editor ever. It allows you to type in raw bits, and it'll encode those bits into ASCII for you on the fly. Even backspace is supported, as it is an ASCII character: correct any mistake with a plain and simple `0001000`!

That's it, so all that is left to say is:
100100011000011110110110010101000001100110111010111011100100001

## Readme from another perspective
This script revolutionises the way we edit text. It dramatically reduces the amount of keys needed on any keyboard, physical or on touch screens, and we are thrilled to be able to offer you this revolution in typing, today, forever, and for free.

For real: imagine the switch from a massive keyboard that contains all Chinese characters, reduced to a keyboard with only the Latin alphabet. Then imagine making that leap once again, and you'll have the 2- to 3-key\* keyboard necessary for this program.

\*: 3rd key required to ever be able to exit the program ever again once started.

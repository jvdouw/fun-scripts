# Cargame

A plan and simple game to play inside your terminal, in which you have to manoeuver a car around hostile objects, while at the same time gathering as many points as possible.

Made with the goal to experiment with making games in Python, while not yet bothering with a GUI (thankfully using the `curses` library)

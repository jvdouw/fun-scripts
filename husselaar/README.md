# Husselaar
The Dutch word "husselaar" means something like "thing that mixes stuff up". I wrote this script back in 2006 to illustrate the psychological principle that if you read a text as a practiced reader, you don't actually read all the letters separately. If you leave the first and the last letter of a word intact, and mix up the rest, you mhigt be spiresurd as to how wlel you are albe to raed eynvtheirg at amoslt nramol raeidng seepd.

Note: the code is in Dutch as well, but it's pretty simple (though I don't claim it is very efficient). I have a live version to try out available on [my website](http://jochemdouw.nl/husselaar/).
